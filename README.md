Welcome to the Personal Learning Platform (PLP) database! This MySQL database is designed to help manage data for a learning platform where users can enroll in courses, submit assignments, track progress, and receive feedback. It is an excellent way to learn about MySQL databases and how they work in a real-world application.

This README will guide you through setting up the database in MySQL, how to interact with it, and provide examples of how to use SQL to interact with your data.
